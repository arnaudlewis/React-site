            <p>We are upbeat, resourceful, and friendly. We motivate and demonstrate
            a can-do attitude to show our customers what good things are possible.
            We know that innovating and getting things done is messy, we acknowledge
            that, and then focus on the solutions together.</p>
            <p>We are not delusional. We know that we make sophisticated, and at
            times complicated tools that take a little time to master. So we dont
            over-promise when it comes to the learning curve. We strive to simplify
            the path and explain the best way forward.</p>
            <p>We make people more productive and less stressed. We cant
            solve every problem a team has, but we empathize and give it our
            best shot.</p>
